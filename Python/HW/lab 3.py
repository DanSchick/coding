### DEFINING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES ###
SPEED = 70
dist6Hrs = 0
dist10Hrs = 0
dist15Hrs = 0



### PERFORMING CALCULATIONS ###
time = 6
dist6Hrs = SPEED * time

time = 10.0
dist10Hrs = SPEED * time

time = 15
dist15Hrs = SPEED * time


### PRINT RESULTS ###
print(dist6Hrs, "miles", dist10Hrs, "miles", dist15Hrs, "miles")
